👋 Hi, I’m Larry  

### :man_technologist: About Me

I’m a backend-focused software engineer who builds calm, resilient systems designed to reduce friction and support long-term flow.

My work centers around making system behavior explicit and predictable—so users and developers can focus on the work itself rather than fighting unclear state, hidden errors, or rushed fixes.

---

### 🔭 What I’m Working On

- Designing Go-based backend systems with clear boundaries and early error handling  
- Building task- and workflow-oriented applications backed by PostgreSQL  
- Developing internal dashboards that surface the right information at the right time  
- Gradually evolving systems without forcing rewrites or urgency-driven refactors  

I tend to work incrementally, prioritizing foundations first and allowing complexity to emerge only when it’s earned.

---

### 🧠 How I Think About Systems

I usually work bottom-up:

**Components → Concepts → Systems → Flow**

- Components should be small and understandable  
- Concepts should compose cleanly  
- Systems should tolerate change  
- Flow should feel uninterrupted for the user  

Most of my design decisions aim to reduce surprise and cognitive load—especially under real-world time constraints.

---

### 🛠 Technical Focus

- **Languages:** Go  
- **Backend:** Fiber, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL  
- **Data Modeling:** Code-first schemas (Ent)  
- **Caching & State:** Redis (in progress)  
- **Frontend:** Server-rendered HTML today, moving toward Next.js  
- **Real-Time:** WebSockets (planned)  
- **Tooling:** Git, GitHub  

---

### 🌱 Outside of Code

Outside of software, I focus on long-running systems that reward patience and iteration—fitness, regenerative projects, and personal skill development.

These experiences strongly influence how I approach engineering: stability matters, feedback loops matter, and systems should help people stay calm under pressure.
